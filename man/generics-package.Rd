\title{generics: common S3 generics}
\description{
These are generic functions that can be used to minimize
package dependencies when multiple packages have the same
method.
}
\details{
An attempt was made to use generic class signatures that were
consistent with existing code. For example, \pkg{dplyr} and
\pkg{lime} both have \code{explain()} methods that do very different
things but both take \code{x} as their main object. Even though \code{x}
would be different in those cases, this package provides access
to the S3 generic so that other packages that may want to create
\code{explain()} methods for their objects can do so without loading
either of the other packages.

For example, if a new \code{tidy()} method is being developed for a
package, this lightweight package can be the required dependency
to have access to the generic method (instead of depending on
\pkg{broom} and installing its dependencies).
